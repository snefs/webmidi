Project to control a USB Midi controller into a web-based controller to generate Synth sounds + Visual effects using the Anime library  Note: This is to let my kids enjoy equipment with bleeps and fireworks. This is a quick recreation of an old UWP where I used the Audio Graph library on the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL, where I found controlling a DJ Mixer using a phone was awesome!
