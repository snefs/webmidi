Project to control a USB Midi controller into a web-based controller to generate Synth sounds + Visual effects using the Anime library  Note: This is to let my kids enjoy equipment with bleeps and fireworks. This is a quick recreation of an old UWP where I used the Audio Graph library on the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL, where I found controlling a DJ Mixer using a phone was awesome!
Tested with DJ Tech Mix 101, CDJ 101, and Echo's the MIDI code to light up the controls. For other controllers, Just change the MIDI event types. Only works on WebMidi capable browsers.
